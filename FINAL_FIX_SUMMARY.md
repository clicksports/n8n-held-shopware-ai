# âœ… Final Fix Applied to "ðŸš€ FIXED: Shopware â†’ Qdrant (LangChain)"

## The Issue
Transform to Documents had no output because:
1. Route Logic was sending data to BOTH outputs simultaneously
2. This caused Transform to receive data before products were fully fetched

## The Fix

### 1. Route Logic - Fixed Output Routing
**Before**: Single output array `return [{ json: data }];`  
**After**: Two separate outputs:
```javascript
if (data.finished) {
  return [[], [{ json: data }]];  // Output 0: empty, Output 1: data
} else {
  return [[{ json: data }], []];  // Output 0: data, Output 1: empty
}
```

### 2. Connections - Separated Outputs
**Before**: Both nodes connected to same output
**After**: 
- Output 0 â†’ Wait (for continuing pagination)
- Output 1 â†’ Transform to Documents (when finished)

### 3. Added Document Loader
- Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader`
- Connected as sub-node to Qdrant (ai_document connection)
- Extracts documents from the JSON array

### 4. Debug Logging
Added console logs to see what data Transform receives

## Workflow Flow

```
When pagination continues:
Route Logic â†’ Output 0 â†’ Wait â†’ Fetch Products

When pagination finished:
Route Logic â†’ Output 1 â†’ Transform to Documents â†’ Qdrant
                                                      â†‘
                              Document Loader â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
                              OpenAI Embeddings â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

## The workflow is now deployed and ready!

Test it in n8n UI:
1. Configure OpenAI credentials
2. Configure Qdrant (URL: http://qdrant:6333)
3. Execute workflow
4. Transform to Documents will now show output when all products are fetched
