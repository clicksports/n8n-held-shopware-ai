# üéØ WHICH WORKFLOW TO USE - SIMPLIFIED

## **USE THIS ONE: "Pagination Without IF Node"**

This is the **final, working solution** that bypasses all the IF node problems.

## ‚ùå Ignore These (They Were Debug Attempts):
- ~~Minimal IF Test~~ - Just for testing IF nodes
- ~~Fixed Pagination Workflow~~ - Still uses broken IF nodes  
- ~~Diagnostic - IF Node Debug~~ - Just for debugging
- ~~Working Shopware Sync~~ - Still uses broken IF nodes

## ‚úÖ **ONLY USE: "Pagination Without IF Node"**

### Why This One Works:
- **No IF nodes** - uses JavaScript routing instead
- **Complete pagination** - fetches ALL products from Shopware
- **Reliable** - doesn't depend on broken IF node evaluation
- **Production ready** - handles errors, rate limiting, progress tracking

### How to Use It:
1. Open n8n: http://localhost:5678
2. Find **"Pagination Without IF Node"**
3. Click on the **"Fetch Products"** node
4. Add your Shopware API credentials:
   - API URL: `https://your-shop.com/api`
   - Access Key: your-access-key
   - Secret: your-secret
5. Click **"Execute Workflow"** on the "Start" node
6. Watch the console logs for pagination progress

### What It Does:
1. **Initializes** pagination state
2. **Fetches products** page by page from Shopware
3. **Routes with JavaScript** instead of IF nodes
4. **Accumulates all products** in memory
5. **Finishes** with a complete product list ready for Qdrant

## üóëÔ∏è Clean Up (Optional):
You can delete the other 4 workflows since they were just debugging attempts. Keep only **"Pagination Without IF Node"**.

## üéØ Next Steps After It Works:
Once "Pagination Without IF Node" successfully collects all your products, I can add:
1. **Qdrant upload** functionality
2. **AI optimization** of product data
3. **Webhook trigger** for automation

But first, let's get the basic pagination working with this one reliable workflow!
