# Product Data Consolidation Solution

This solution addresses the issue of fragmented product data being stored across multiple vector database points by consolidating content and metadata into unified product records.

## Problem

Product data was scattered across multiple vector database points with separated content and metadata:
- Individual product attributes stored as separate points
- Metadata isolated from content
- No unified product structure
- Difficult to retrieve complete product information

## Solution

### Files Created

1. **`product-schema.json`** - JSON Schema defining the consolidated product structure
2. **`consolidate-products.js`** - Core consolidation logic
3. **`example-usage.js`** - Usage examples and transformation demo

### Consolidated Structure

Products are now stored with:
- **Unified Content**: All product attributes (article, price, stock, etc.) in one place
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Source tracking, timestamps, and fragment history
- **Preserved Vectors**: Original vector embeddings maintained
- **Traceability**: Track which fragments contributed to the final product

### Key Features

- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically parses different content formats
- **Content Merging**: Intelligently combines fragments into complete products
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains all original metadata and source information
- **Fragment Tracking**: Records how the consolidated product was assembled

### Usage

```javascript
const ProductConsolidator = require('./consolidate-products');

// Transform your fragmented vector points
const consolidatedProducts = ProductConsolidator.transformVectorPoints(fragmentedPoints);
```

This ensures each product's content and metadata are stored together as a single, complete record while maintaining full traceability to the original fragmented data.
