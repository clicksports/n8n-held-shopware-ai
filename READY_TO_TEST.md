- **Qdrant**: Running at http://localhost:6333 ✓
- **Collection**: `shopware_products` already exists ✓
- **Workflows**: Deployed and ready ✓

## 🚀 Quick Test

1. **Open n8n**: http://localhost:5678
2. **Find workflow**: "🚀 FINAL: Shopware → Qdrant (LangChain)"
3. **Configure credentials**:
   - OpenAI API key (for embeddings)
   - Qdrant (URL: http://qdrant:6333)
4. **Execute workflow** manually

## 📊 What Will Happen

The workflow will:
1. ✅ Authenticate with Shopware OAuth
2. ✅ Fetch ALL products (not just 25)
3. ✅ Generate text embeddings via OpenAI
4. ✅ Store in Qdrant for semantic search

## 🔍 Verify Success

- Check Qdrant Dashboard: http://localhost:6333/dashboard
- Look for `shopware_products` collection
- Should contain 50+ products with 1536-dim vectors

## 🆘 If Issues Occur

Use the fallback workflow:
- "✅ ULTIMATE: Shopware → Qdrant Working"
- This fetches all products without upload
- Export data for manual processing

**Ready to test!** The workflows are deployed and waiting for you in the n8n UI.
