# üßπ Workflow Cleanup Guide

## Current Situation
- **17 Shopware workflows** exist in n8n (16 old + 1 new)
- All old workflows are **deactivated** (shown as "Inactive" in UI)
- They cannot be deleted via CLI (n8n doesn't have delete command)

## ‚úÖ THE ONLY WORKFLOW TO USE:

### **"FINAL WORKING: Shopware ‚Üí Qdrant Sync"**
- **Workflow ID**: 04SLENEQMK6TZy14
- **Status**: Ready to use
- **Features**: 
  - Fetches ALL products (handles API pagination bug)
  - Correct Qdrant format (numeric IDs, proper payload)
  - Deletes/recreates collection to avoid conflicts
  - Smart error handling

## üóëÔ∏è To Clean Up in n8n UI:

You can manually delete these inactive workflows from the n8n web interface:

1. Production Fixed: Shopware to Qdrant
2. Production: Shopware to Qdrant Sync
3. FINAL: JS-Only Shopware to Qdrant
4. Final: Shopware to Qdrant Sync
5. Test Shopware Credentials
6. Functional Shopware Sync
7. Working Shopware Sync
8. Connected Shopware Test
9. Simple Shopware Test
10. Shopware to Qdrant - Debug Fixed
11. Shopware to Qdrant - Full Catalog Fixed
12. Shopware to Qdrant - Full Catalog Sync
13. Shopware to Qdrant - Final Version
14. Shopware to Qdrant - Direct Connection Fixed
15. Shopware to Qdrant - Optimized Production (both versions)

## üöÄ Quick Start:

1. Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
2. Find **"FINAL WORKING: Shopware ‚Üí Qdrant Sync"**
3. Click "Execute Workflow"
4. Watch the console output
5. Check Qdrant at http://localhost:6333/dashboard

## üìä Expected Results:
- Fetches 50+ products (not just 25)
- Creates `shopware_products` collection
- Uploads first 100 products
- Shows complete sync status

## üí° Tips:
- All old workflows are deactivated but still visible
- You can delete them manually in the UI for a cleaner view
- Or just ignore them - they won't interfere
- The FINAL WORKING version has all fixes applied
